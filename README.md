Task 4: Customer Segmentation Visualization
Objective:
Group customers into meaningful segments based on their demographic and usage patterns to tailor marketing and retention strategies.

Key Activities:

Feature selection: Used relevant customer attributes such as tenure, monthly charges, contract type, and services subscribed.

Clustering technique: Applied clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) to identify distinct customer groups.

Visualization: Used scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps to illustrate customer segments.

Interpretation: Defined characteristics of each segment (e.g., high-value loyal customers vs. at-risk customers) to guide business decisions.
